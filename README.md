# PlantBuddies Beta

is a tool to help you find companion plants, fast and simple.

## The Idea
Those big companion planting charts and tables always fascinated and confused me at the same time. PlantBuddies is our attempt to make the data more accessible and easy to use.

## Technology
This prototype it is a static site hosted on GitHub Pages relying on 
[`jQuery`](https://jquery.com/) und [`typeahead.js`](https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/
) for most of the work.
Code will get a cleanup before we can call it finished.
